Bobs Burgers Click Game is a memory game created with React. 


This application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. 

This application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if you click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
